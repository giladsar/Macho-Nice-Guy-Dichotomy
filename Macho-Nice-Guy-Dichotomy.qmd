## HisWords repo

For our purpose we would use the same approach that Tessa E. S. Charlesworth et al. chose. Namely,the HisWords repo which is open online in [GitHub](https://github.com/williamleif/histwords?tab=readme-ov-file).

### What's going on?

HistWords is an open-source dataset and toolkit that provides word embeddings for different historical periods, trained on Google Books Ngram (and other corpora). Each decade (1800–1990) has its own 300-dimensional vector space representing the meaning of words in that era.

Think of it as a longitudinal semantic dataset — instead of people measured over time, we have words measured across decades. Each vector encodes a word’s position in the shared “meaning space” of its time.

#### What we can do with it?

Inspect meaning: find nearest neighbors of a word in any decade.

Compare meanings over time: compute cosine similarity between the same word across decades to track semantic drift.

Study cultural change: analyze how the associations of a word (e.g., macho, nice) evolve by decade.

Compose phrases: average vectors (e.g., macho + guy) to represent multi-word concepts.

Align embeddings: apply sequential Procrustes alignment to make spaces from different decades comparable.
